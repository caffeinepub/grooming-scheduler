  "summary": "Frontend implements a two-step groomer→services scheduler flow with React Query loading/error/retry states and a non-blue/purple theme. Backend exposes query APIs for groomers and services, but appears to lack required seed/sample data and stable identifiers for services (and groomer IDs may not be stable/unique).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Backend can be initialized with seed/sample groomers and services so the UI is usable immediately after deployment.",
      "reason": "The backend initializes `groomers` as an empty Map and provides only mutation methods to add data later; no seed/sample data initialization is shown.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo (let groomers = Map.empty<Nat, Groomer>(); no prepopulation/initialization code)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Returned data includes stable identifiers and display names for groomers and services.",
      "reason": "Services have no identifier field at all (only title/description/priceRange), and groomer IDs are derived from `name.size()` which is not guaranteed stable/unique across groomers with same-length names.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo (type Service = { title; description; priceRange; } — no id)",
        "backend/main.mo (func createGroomer: let id = name.size();)"

      "description": "Backend mutation APIs to add groomers and add services to groomers (write methods).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asked for query methods to list groomers and list services for a groomer; write/admin functionality was not requested.",
      "evidence": [
