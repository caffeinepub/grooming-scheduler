  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all seven requirements (REQ-19 through REQ-25). A new /groomer-onboard route was created with a comprehensive registration form, service management interface, and backend integration. The page collects groomer details (name, email, phone, business name), allows adding/editing/removing services with title/description/price range, and uses Chewy blue styling consistently. Backend methods for groomer registration and service storage were implemented with stable storage migration support. React Query integration provides loading states, success messages, and error handling with retry. Bidirectional navigation between scheduler and onboarding pages was added with Chewy blue styled buttons.",
